        <h5>DISCOVER</h5>
    <P>Hello Welcome...! ( Bem Vindos-Portuguese, Bienvenidos-Spanish)
 Have you ever wondered if it's possible to learn Software Engineering, Computer programming and much more from the comfort of your own home if you never done before...? And where can you find more information about it? I also thought about this prior to starting my online program, and yes, I think it's possible to learn. I am trying to create my very first webpage, I named it: Discover, because that is where I'm currently in my software engineer program, trying to learn and discover things. This is my first time studying software, and my first project as well, build an website from scratch, or trying to...! It's quite an adventure.</p>

        <p>This is a short-term online program with an amazing University, Below are some additional details...! I got into this program through an excellent online Global Platform, here are some of them <span style="color:#42c0fb">("WWW.COURSERA.ORG, WWW.EDX.ORG, WWW.UDACITY.COM, WWW.UDEMY.COM")</span> That provide life changing and learning experiences to learners around the world, offering anyone, anywhere, access to online courses and degrees from leading universities and companies in different languages. I speak Portuguese, spanish and English, perhapes you can find some of these programs in your native language as well. Some months ago, when I first started this program, I had no experience, Today, there is better work in progress, it's fascinating. Thanks to all software teachers and instructors out there.</p>

This is my first time studying software, and my first project as well, building a website from scratch, or trying too...! It's quite an adventures. This is a short-term online program with any amazing University,  <u><mark>Below there is more Info with a Link...!</mark></u>  I got into this program through an excellent online Global Platform,(<b>WWW.COURSERA.ORG</b>) that provide life changing experiences to learners worldwide, given anyone, anywhere, access to online courses and degrees from leading universities and companies in different languages as well. I speak Portuguese, spanish and English, I could see their program in other languages also. (3)weeks ago, when I started this program, I had no experience, Now it's getting better, work in progress. It's fascinating, Thanks to all software teachers and instructors out there, looking forward too.<ol ="1"> <li>Software Developer</li><li>Data Engineer</li><li>Algorithm</li></ol><ul ="disc"><li>Keep learning</li><li>Add more Languages to the Site</li><li>Portuguese, Spanish</li></ul></2></p></I></div>
